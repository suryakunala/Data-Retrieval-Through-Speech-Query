    "## Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via pre-training\n",
    "<i>Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task</i>. To alleviate the collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition, the generated logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving the denotation. In this paper, we present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT’s architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia, and is trained end-to-end.<br><br>\n",
    "TAPAS is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is therefore efficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. Models trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard.\n",
    "TAPAS has checkpoints fine-tuned on SQA, which are capable of answering questions related to a table in a conversational set-up. This means that you can ask follow-up questions such as “what is his age?” related to the previous question. Note that the forward pass of TAPAS is a bit different in case of a conversational set-up: in that case, you have to feed every table-question pair one by one to the model, such that the prev_labels token type ids can be overwritten by the predicted labels of the model to the previous question."
